  1888: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}The area highlighted in blue is the catchment area of the station. The more buildings in the catchment area the more passengers will use your station..."
  1889: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Check the station position accepts passengers otherwise you won't be able to unload them and won't be paid. Watch the ‚ÄúCatchment Area‚Äù text at the bottom of the construction window..."
  1890: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}When you're happy with the location, click the left mouse button to build the station..."
  1891: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}We'll build the second station at the opposite side of town..."

  1893: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}We have a choice of two bus types. Let's choose the newer design which carries more passengers..."
  1894: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Move the mouse cursor to position the bus on a road and click the left mouse button to place it..."
  1895: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Before we set the bus going it needs to know where to go to. Select the route details tab on the vehicle window..."

  1897: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Now we can set the bus going..."
  1898: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Let's watch it pick up its first passengers..."

  # Tutorial 2
  1899: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}We're going to build a bus service to transport passengers between Boulder Bay and Breakers Bridge. As there are no roads linking the towns, we'll need to build one..."
  1900: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Select the orientation of the new section of road, and click on the view to start construction..."
  1901: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Clicking the 'build this' icon will add more road sections of the same type..."
  1902: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Before continuing, here's a quicker way of starting road construction..."
  1903: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Just click the right mouse button on the end of the road you want to extend..."
  1904: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}We need to turn left here, so select a left hand curve..."
  1905: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}And now back to building straight again..."
  1906: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}That's the road built, now for the stations..."
