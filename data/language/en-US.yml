  1889: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}Check the station position accepts passengers otherwise you won't be able to unload them and won't be paid. Watch the “Catchment Area” text at the bottom of the construction window..."
  1890: "{SMALLFONT}{COLOUR BLACK}When you're happy with the location, click the left mouse button to build the station..."

  # Tutorial 2
