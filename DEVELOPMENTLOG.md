# OpenLoco version 23.12+ (???)

## Mountain tool game command implementation (#2167)

Our work on reimplementing the game commands continues. This month, we've finally tackled
the mountain tool game command! Like most of the remaining game command functions, this was
a complex beast to reimplement. However, it was definitely worth doing, as we'll elaborate on
in the next section.

We have now reimplemented 55 out of 84 game commands in C++. The remaining commands are
huge functions to undertake, so the implementation pace has slowed down a bit. However,
reimplementing them is a necessity for stable multiplayer, so it's a worthy cause!

## Terraform tool improvements (#2228, #2243)

In Locomotion, the terraform tools were limited to 10x10 tiles. As of this month, OpenLoco
reimplements all terraform tools in C++, making it possible to increase the tool sizes without
unintentional side-effects. We didn't just increase them a little: the new limit is 64x64 tiles!

We didn't stop there. Now that the mountain tool has been reimplemented, we've made it possible
to use it with a variable table size! Previously, the mountain tool would be activated by
minimizing the land tool all the way, giving you a mountain with a 1x1 table. We have now
changed this such that you can activate mountain slopes for all tool sizes! Enjoy!

Lastly, we've changed the way the land style 'paint' tool works. The land style selector is
now hidden until the paint tool is activated. In addition, the tool no longer confusingly
inherits corner selection from the general land tool. We hope this leads to more intuitive
use of the land style paint tool.

## Make viewport see-through flags more granular (#2231)

The way hiding viewport elements works in Locomotion has often been suggested for improvement.
Our codebase is now in such a state where we could finally rework this. The see-through flags
are now more granular and no longer group several kinds of tile elements together.
For example, you can now decide to only hide train tracks, or indeed only hide roads.
Similarly, there are now separate flags for buildings, trees, and scenery objects.

This means the viewport menu replaces two old items with five new items. Previously, the
viewport shortcuts matched these positions. For consistency, the viewport shortcuts have
therefore been reassigned. Existing shortcut configurations will not be updated, however.
We recommend you review or reset the shortcut settings to make optimal use of the new flags.

Aside from the refined granularity, the see-through flags now apply to the entire viewport,
rather than only the bottom half. We hope this will make the flags more convenient to use as well.

## Refactor config reading and writing (#2229, #2230)

To keep track of user preferences for the extra options introduced by OpenLoco, we introduced
YAML-formatted user config files back in 2018. While the underlying library we used has been
updated a few times since, our config handling code has remained more or less the same since,
save for adding more and more options on top.

This month, we have reworked the config reading and writing code. This has made the code more
flexible with respect to invalid or missing configurations. Perhaps more importantly, the code
defers logic to such an extent that it is easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Turn window-specific handleInput functions into keyUp events (#2232)

The recent few months saw an influx of new search/text fields to major game windows, such as
the Build Vehicle and Object Selection windows. The way we handled key presses to be passed
to the windows wasn't the prettiest, however. This month, we completely refactored this,
turning the respective `handleInput` events into proper `keyUp` window events. This makes
things much more maintainable, and indeed easier to add such events in the future.

## Refactor and split up the Input namespace (#2246, #2247)

The changes to key input handling discussed in the previous section cleaned up the Input
namespace quite a bit. However, it also revealed plenty more work to be done, separating core
input logic from gameplay functions. We started by moving screenshot trigger logic out of the
Input namespace, and moved a bunch of viewport interaction code to its own code unit as well.
More to be done in the future, but this kind of cleanup is very rewarding to do. Stay tuned!

# OpenLoco version 23.12 (2023-12-17)

## Enable extra optimizations for Windows release builds (#2204)

While working on our sister project OpenRCT2, @ZehMatt noticed some of the optimizations he
applied there could also be applied to OpenLoco. As it turns out, particular compiler intrinsics
were not enabled, which meant that direct memory writes were disabled and memcpy calls were used
instead. In addition, the linker wasn't eliminating unreferenced data and code, nor were identical
functions merged. Enabling the right intrinsics for the MSVC compiler shrinks the OpenLoco binary
by as much as 300 KiB, and has decreased the amount of functions from 10,195 down to 6,899.
As @ZehMatt puts it, free code and size optimizations, basically. Yay!

# Fix crash when clipping strings (#2207)

A few months ago, we changed how strings were processed in game. This unexpectedly led to crashes
in some places in the game. What happened?

While games nowadays have happily adopted Unicode for most of their text strings (e.g. through UTF-8),
OpenLoco, like Locomotion, currently uses a dialect of the [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1)
code page to present text  to the player. We say it's a dialect, because some code points defined
in this standard are used for other purposes, such as the icons for stations you see in labels,
or as *formatting codes*, e.g. text colours. Dealing with these can be a bit delicate,
and until we've reimplemented every function that deals with strings, we've got to keep it as-is.

Turns out there's a mysterious formatting code at the start of company names, 0x90 in hexadecimal.
Our code was tripping over this particular byte, leading to the crash. Hopefully, we can get
rid of the hack that solved it soon.

# Fix landscape generator not taking town size limits into account (#2209)

In July, we merged our implementation of the createTown game command. What we didn't notice in
the review process, is that the town size limit wasn't being passed properly, leading
to an unexpected abundance of metropoles on maps that were expecting small towns only!
Fortunately, the issue was identified and resolved quickly after it was reported --
though it took a while to discover, it seems!

## Implement track/road ordering functions, and PaintSession refactor (#2216, #2218)

We're expanding our efforts again, this time into what we call the *paint* part of the game.
As many of you know, the game uses prerendered *sprites* for showing landscapes, vehicles etc.
on the game canvas. The functions that map game data onto these sprites, are what we call
*paint* functions.

This month, @duncanspumpkin implemented the paint functions that reorder the track and road sprites
to draw them properly. The nice thing is that our implementation of these functions can be
written to be much more compact than the originals. We hope that this will not only leave
them to be more readable, but to lead to faster performance eventually as well.

Later in the same week, @ZehMatt then took the opportunity to refactor the `PaintSession`
to bundle variables and improve readability. Loads more to do, but we're chipping away at these!

## Fix behavioural divergence regressions from v23.10 (#2217)

We use *replay* tests to try to ensure we don't break any vanilla game logic while we
reimplement the game's functions one-by-one. Unfortunately, we missed a few regressions
caused by recent C++ implementations of some of the vehicle logic. Thankfully,
@duncanspumpkin discovered and identified the issues, and they are fixed now.

## Fix cursor resetting when the game auto saves (#2223)

During testing, @ZehMatt noticed that the game triggering an auto save would reset the cursor
to a regular pointer, rather than the cursor for whatever tool might have been active.
Nothing game-breaking, but a good thing to have fixed!

## Fix route-through order assignments (#2200)

Assigning vehicles an order to stop at a particular station is simple: you just click their label
once. Clicking it twice will order the vehicle to *route through* the station instead.
Or does it? It turned out our implementation of assigning such route-through orders worked
differently from vanilla. @duncanspumpkin worked out that, while vanilla's worked on the
*previous* order, ours would work on the *highlighted* order instead. Given that assigning
an order automatically moves the selected order forward by one, we would always be off by one,
breaking this double-clicking behaviour! Glad to have this one fixed as well.

## Mouse wheel input refactor (#2225)

Rapidly zooming in and out of the map led to some jittery scrolling behaviour, @ZehMatt found.
This led him to identify and fix an underlying bug, and clean up the code a little in the
process. Nice work!

# OpenLoco version 23.11 (2023-11-26)

## Object Selection (#2128, #2149, #2185)

Some of our recent features have had to do with the object selection window. Sadly, though,
we can't add much more due to limitations with the internal object index structure. The
solution is to move to a new, OpenLoco-specific structure. To allow us to do that, though,
we need to have reimplemented every function that uses it. Hence, this trio of PR's that
finishes off almost all of the functions. Whilst implementing them, one or two little
mistakes were fixed. Error messages for some object selection errors have been improved,
and 'object in use' errors now correctly handle signals.

## Vehicle Functions (#2158, #2164, #2165, #2166, #2169, #2175, #2177)

@duncanspumpkin had the urge to implement a number of vehicle functions this month. Most of
these had been left on the to do pile due to there being too many unknowns about tracks.
However, earlier in the year we had a bit of a breakthrough of knowledge in that area,
so these were easy to finish off. Hopefully, next year we can finish off `Vehicle::update`!

## Fix slow start-up with blank game window (#2184)

OpenLoco introduces ways to play the game at higher resolutions than the game was designed for,
including ways to scale the game canvas. This is particularly needed on double-density displays,
where pixels are smaller than they were on traditional displays. However, a problem that had
been plaguing the game for a while, was slow game start-up times when such large-resolution
displays were used. After much debugging, it turns out that we were still invoking the
vanilla Locomotion graphics initialisation routine -- something that hasn't been necessary
for a long time. Our C++ code was actually able to handle such larger displays just fine.
Removing the call to the vanilla routine solved the problem, making the game start up
much faster.

## Use more C++20 features (#2170)

Now that we are using C++20, we no longer require some of our custom utility functions.
This PR removed `popcount`, `rol`, `ror`, and introduced the 'spaceship' operator to a
number of our custom types. The spaceship operator is the most fun of the four: the
compiler can now generate <, <=, >, >= operations by just implementing a spaceship,
`<=>`. This should improve the code generation and simplifies the codebase.

## Build improvements (#2172, #2178, #2181, #2183)

The latest GCC 13 was released and generated a number of warnings when compiling our
codebase. These have been addressed where doable. We've also added new CI images that
compile against GCC 13 and improved our build setup for this.

## Object Structure (#2179, #2188)

@LeftOfZen has been working on a C# object tool, and whilst implementing it, he noticed
a few little improvements/fixes that could be made. It's great to have another
implementation of the object code, as it will mean we can identify more of the
unknowns and reduce the number of bugs.

# OpenLoco version 23.10 (2023-10-25)

## Switch codebase to C++20 (#1843, #2136, #2144)

Pretty much since the project got started, we've been adhering to the C++17 standard. This allowed us to
use modern C++, including the modern filesystem classes. However, as the name C++20 suggests, a new
standard has been out for a while. There were a few blockers that prevented us from switching, however.
This month, the last blockers were resolved by @Duncanspumpkin and @ZehMatt, and so we can now compile
the entire codebase as C++20!

Happily, this also removed the need to use a 3rd-party library for `span` support, as we can now
just use the C++ standard library for this. Code-wise, we look forward to using more C++20 types everywhere,
which should make our lives a little easier.

## Add filters to Build Vehicle window (#2148)

One of the frequent remarks we got from players, is how tedious it can be to find the right components
when building a vehicle. This month, @AaronVanGeffen set out to make this easier. The Build Vehicle
window now allows you to filter vehicle components by powered/unpowered types, as well as supported cargo.
If that isn't enough, you can even search for vehicle components by name. We hope this will help in
your vehicle-building needs!

PS: It's already been suggested we add these new filters to the Object Selection window as well.
We can't do this easily yet, but it's on our List of Things To Do.

## Add cheat to remove station loading penalty for long vehicles (#2151)

A dedicated part of the game's fan base is eager to make rich dioramas with very long vehicles.
Long-time players have relied on the 'Long Station Patch' to make stations that can actually accommodate
such long vehicles. For various reasons, OpenLoco cannot provide these newer limits *yet*.
However, as a compromise, players can now choose to disable the slow (un)loading that would be the
result of stationing overly long vehicles in shorter stations. Thanks, @LeftOfZen!
We hope this will allow more players to enjoy OpenLoco, even without longer stations.

## Use global game state everywhere (#2129, #2131, #2132, #2133, #2137, #2139, #2142, #2145)

When the project was started, the idea of the `loco_global` struct was conceived: a high-level wrapper around
a particular memory address. This ensured that we could start using strongly typed C++ from the get go,
instead of having to rely on raw addresses for longer. After, we introduced a `GameState` struct that encompasses
the memory space dealing with, in effect, how the landscape and everything in it is stored.

This month, @memellis has continued working on reducing the number of these `loco_global` variables
in the codebase, by making these code use of the global `GameState` instead. As we wrote last month,
this is an important task that needs to be completed before we can start looking at increasing the
in-game limits of OpenLoco, and it improves the structure of the codebase.

At this point, there are very few `loco_global` variables left that can be replaced with a `GameState`
reference. There are plenty other `loco_global`s remaining, though. Most of these have to do with more
transient variables, though, such as anything to do with UI. As most of the code paths involved are no
longer shared with vanilla, we can look into integrating these soon.

## Demystifying the Locomotion AI (#2052)

Locomotion's AI companies are responsible for some of the most contrived, spaghetti-like transport
networks in game. However, before we can improve on this, we first have to understand and reimplement
the existing AI. @Duncanspumpkin has set out to do exactly that. It's been rather tedious to do,
so don't expect an improved AI in the immediate future. However, progress is progress, and we're
happy Duncan's on the job!

# OpenLoco version 23.09 (2023-09-28)

A bit of a quiet month compared to last one, but there was still a good bit of work done.

## Drawing engine refactoring

@ZehMatt has been working on improving the drawing engine, getting it into a better state for separating the rendering of the UI from the game viewport.
This month, it's cleaning up the invalidation grid, which tells the game what parts of the game viewport need to be redrawn.
A poorly optimised invalidation grid will cause decreased frame rates and can be the source of graphical z-fighting.

## Load company face from company name

A little known feature of Locomotion is that you can change your company face image by typing in the name of a competitor object as your company name.
We only found out about this feature when implementing the function that did it.

## General refactoring and cleanup

@memellis has been working on reducing the number of global variables in the codebase by using the existing game state global.
This is an important task that needs to be completed before we can start looking at increasing limits of OpenLoco, and it improves the structure of the codebase.

@NEJulnes fixed a long standing mistake in our variable names and localisation files related to formatting of fixed precision numbers.
Turns out we have two decimal place fixed precision, and also one decimal place. It was just named incorrectly.

@ilmoro93 attempted to build the project on Windows and realised our setup instructions were incorrect!
Thanks for fixing that, it's always important to have easy to follow setup instructions as it often scares off contributors if they are incorrect.

@LeftOfZen fixed a couple of typos in the codebase (sorry, I think I added them...) and addressed static analysis warnings.
Static analysis warnings are important to stay on top of, they often indicate poorly written code or bugs (or both).

## Create Track Mod game command

Track mods are what we call things like the third rail on track.
The game command for placing them is quite complex and requires iterating along the rail track to ensure it is being placed on the whole track network or track block.
Now that it's been completed, we have a much better understanding of how track iteration works in the game.
This should hopefully be the gateway to having an automatic signal placement feature.

## Expert mode object selection

@AaronVanGeffen worked on a few UI related items this month, but the main one was the expert mode for the object selection.
When in expert mode, every single object type is shown to the player.
In addition, Aaron added filter options so that the object selection can show only vanilla Locomotion objects,
or only custom objects (or both).
Hopefully, this will make things easier for scenario makers to find the objects they wish to add.

## Draw string ticker

When news items are generated in the game, they can be set to create a newspaper-like window,
or they can be sent to the news ticker in the bottom right corner of the screen.
The ticker message has a surprisingly complex bit of code for drawing the message, so hadn't been implemented.
Now that it has been done, it's showing some of the issues we have in the codebase related to string drawing.
Over the next few months, we hope to improve string drawing. Eventually, it would be good to finally be
able to display languages that don't use the Latin alphabet!

# OpenLoco version 23.08.1 (2023-08-30)

In v23.06, we introduced our implementation of the Vehicle Order Insert game command.
Unfortunately we forgot to activate our new code until v23.07. Due to this mistake,
testing of the game command was not very robust and we accidentally broke waypoint
vehicle orders. This is fixed in v23.08.1.

Waypoint orders are comprised of a position x, y, z and the track rotation and type.
The x, y, z was correct, but the rotation and type was being corrupted. This meant
that vehicles could never find the track location that the waypoint was associated
with! Luckily it was easy enough to fix, and as the x, y, z was correct, we can infer
the correct rotation and type.

We have noticed though that waypoints in general behave a bit odd. This issue
predates v23.06, though, so we plan to further look into how vehicles are using
them next month.

# OpenLoco version 23.08 (2023-08-16)

Another month, another OpenLoco release. Owing in part to the summer having been quite
rainy in our corner of the world, this has been such a busy month for the project
again! Let's dive into the most major changes...

## Vehicle object selection is now grouped by vehicle type (#2036, #2085, #2092)

A common complaint from players setting up scenarios, is that their vehicle object
list gets too long to easily wade through. In February, we alleviated this somewhat
by introducing search filters to the object selection window. This month,
@AaronVanGeffen expanded on this by adding an extra set of tab groups to the vehicle
object selection tab. To keep things performant, the game's object index will
automatically be rebuilt once to now keep track of vehicle subtypes as well.
@Duncanspumpkin's latest work on the object index is paying off nicely here!

## Construction improvements (#2078)

Constructing impressive transport layouts is at the heart of the game. We've improved
a few things this month. First off, the construction ghost for buildings now shows the
building in their constructed form, rather than just the scaffolding needed to build
it. Moreover, placing a company headquarters now respects the keyboard shortcut for
rotation (defaults to Z), so you can build it just at the angle you like it. The same
goes for new industries and other buildings you construct in-game. Finally, we also
fixed a bug from the original game, where the yellow construction marker would stick
around after closing the construction window.

Our work on the game commands over the past few months is really paying off here.
We couldn't have easily tackled these issues without it!

## More game commands reimplementation (#2061, #2065, #2066, #2076)

The remaining game commands are all huge functions to undertake, so the pace has
slowed down a bit compared to earlier months. This month, @Duncanspumpkin has tackled
the signal placement game command. Functionally, it is identical to the old version,
but it's all in C++ now! Ready for multiplayer in the future.

We're about 65% into the game command reimplementation process now. This meant there
were a bunch of files in just the one `GameCommand` folder. @ZehMatt set out to split
these up into logical units, with game commands grouped by themed subfolders. For
example, `Terraform` or `Vehicle`. This has cleaned things up nicely!

## Some love for the file browser (#2051, #2087, #2088)

This month, some longstanding minor bugs in the in-game file browser were addressed.
Disk drives are accessible again on Windows, and accented characters now display
correctly, as long as the in-game sprite font supports them.

Another issue that went under the radar for a while is that the game would not close
cleanly when the file browser is open. @ZehMatt fixed that one, too.

## Smoother right-click scrolling (#2057)

A bug that had us stumped for a while, was why right-click scrolling would sometimes
stutter. Crucially, this wouldn't happen with window scaling off. Well, as it turns
out, the problem was that we were a bit too enthusiastic with scaling the mouse
position in this case. Our thanks go out to first-time contributor @RednibCoding for
fixing this one!

## Work on the map generator (#2054, #2081, #2084)

Our implementations for the map generator is still calling into vanilla *Locomotion*
routines a lot. Over the years, our understanding of the game's structures has
improved considerably, so it's become much easier to implement them now than it
would have been back then. And so we did! The original height map generator has been
tackled, which also led to us discovering a years-old bug with setting water levels
at map edges.

With our implementation expanding, we also finally split up the map generator code
into several smaller files. A cleaner code base makes it nicer for us to work in,
but importantly for new contributors as well. We hope to see more of you in the
future!

## Assigning map window colours (#2072, #2073)

Like the map generator, the map window was still using a bunch of vanilla code.
This month, we implemented the functions assigning colours to industries and routes.
Fun fact! Did you know all of them have a preferred colour? Sometimes those
preferences clash, however, and it becomes a first-come, first-served kind of
situation. In that case, the first available colour is assigned instead to the others.

## Exceptional work on exceptions (#2068, #2074)

Exception handling, or lack thereof, was a big cause for debugging woes. No more!
@ZehMatt added handling such that the line and file throwing the exception are
now included in the exception message. Thanks!

## The hardest problem in computer science: naming things (#2049, #2050, #2062, #2064)

We've been quite strict with trying to name variables and functions as soon as possible,
but sometimes clarity only strikes after more implementation. @ZehMatt and @duncanspumpin
had a few such epiphanies this month, even finding remnamts of *things* that should've
been renamed into *entities* years ago. Good to have that sorted!

## Using FileStream for better status reporting (#2067, #2075)

In June, @ZehMatt worked on refactoring our custom stream classes to be more efficient
and generalisible. This month, he's expanded their use in the codebase. Conveniently,
this means it's now much easier for them to report on their progress, for instance
when processing the object index. Neat!

# OpenLoco version 23.07 (2023-07-25)

## Use height instead of width to initialize the RT buffer (#2001)

Recent work on using a hardware backend for window scaling accidentally introduced a bug which could lead to
failure to start OpenLoco when using window scaling. This rendered the game unplayable for some. This has now
been fixed. Our apologies!

## Allow scrolling up and down on steppers to change their values (#2019)

One of the often-cited favourite quality of life features introduced by OpenRCT2, our sister project, is the
ability to manipulate +/- stepper values using the mouse scrollwheel. @Broxzier's work has now been introduced
in OpenLoco as well.

## Fix Breakpad crash dump creation (#2032)

For a few years, we have used the Breakpad library on Windows. This allows us to handle crashes gracefully,
generating crash reports that may be analysed by us developers to find the cause. Unfortunately, a recent refactor
of our CMake configuration files led to it being disabled for Windows builds as well. @ZehMatt has fixed this,
so crashes are handled through Breakpad once more.

## Introduce getClampedRange and getWorldRange (#2024)

As you might image, the game often iterates over map tiles to perform certain calculations over them. This could
be as a result of player interaction, e.g. applying a terraform tool, or without player interaction, e.g.
calculating cargo generated by an industry. Either way, it is important that the range of tiles is both complete
and valid. We have now introduced two helper functions that make sure our tile ranges do not extend outside the
map bounds. This fixes a bug that some players reported when trying to change tile textures on the map edge.

## Implement more terraform game commands (#1998, #2008, #2010, #2031)

Last month, we implemented the clear land game command. This set up the stage for the other terraform game commands
to be implemented. This month, we've tackled five more of them: raise/lower land, raise/lower water, and create wall.
These do pretty much what you'd expect them to do, except many hidden caveats that led to us spending many hours
debugging why our implementations behaved slightly different to vanilla! We should be fully compatible now, though.
One more terraform game command remains: the mountain tool game command. And boy, is it a big one...

## Implement the build/remove company HQ game commands (#2020, #2021)

Continuing our folly of reimplementing all game commands in C++, we have also tackled the construction of company
headquarters! Thankfully, after the terraform game commands, these were relatively simple functions that deferred
most of the logic to the general build/remove building game commands. However, having now tackled them, we can start
thinking of extending them, e.g. to expose building rotation to the HQ placement tool.

## Implement the create/remove town game commands (#2022, #2023)

While town creation or removal isn't a common occurrence in normal scenario play, both are game commands as well!
Our quest to reimplement all of them lead us to work on both. Ultimately, this should make it easier to place new
towns in a more organic way as well.

## Implement vehicle pickup aircraft game command (#2025)

There are three game commands dealing with picking up vehicles: one deals with road and track vehicles, one for
boats, and one for aircraft. This game command deals with the latter. This means we've now implemented all three!

## Remove window event interop (#2015)

Now that all windows have been reimplemented in C++, we can drop the compatibility layer for interopting with
vanilla window routines. This also means we can work towards increasing the amount of windows players can have
open at the same time.

## Add BH/CH/D/G headers to tile inspector (#2013)

OpenLoco's tile inspector can be an invaluable tool for debugging tile behaviour. While not yet remotely as
powerful as OpenRCT2's, we make use of it quite often to figure out and label tile fields. This month, we've
made it a bit more useful, adding headers for base height, clearance height, direction, and ghost flag to the list
of tile elements.

## Actually use our vehicleOrderInsert implementation (#2014, #2016)

Last month, we proudly touted that we'd reimplemented all route order game commands. Except... we weren't actually
using one of them yet! After changing this, we promptly found an edge case that could lead to a crash. Thankfully,
we discovered that one ahead of the release, so it hasn't bothered any players.

# OpenLoco version 23.06 (2023-06-12)

## Hardware backed window scaling (#1965)

OpenLoco has had integer window for a few years now. A frequent request was to allow scaling at half or other fractional scales, however. This was already possible if players cleverly manipulated their config files, but the resulting scaling didn't look very nice -- which is why the game UI did not expose it. Making it look nice, however, meant reimplementing the SDL canvas backend to use GPU hardware display for our software renderer. @ZehMatt was up for the task, and made it work very nicely indeed. Check it out!

## Regressions from new clear command (#1967, #1980)

Our last release saw us implementing the 'swiss army knife' of construction functions. Our testing didn't reveal any problems, but shortly after the release, it became clear that this was too good to be true. In fact, there were two. Players could no longer change land textures -- thankfully a minor problem -- but certain 'clear' functions would crash the game entirely. Some debugging, both problems have been eliminated. Hopefully, v23.06 will prove to be more stable!

## Clear tile function (#1959)

Having implemented the 'swiss army knife' of construction functions, @duncanspumpkin implemented the bulldozer tool's clear tile function. Many game commands use instructions like this, so it is great to have a good, working example for implementing the rest.

## Make the news sound optional (#1963)

Locomotion's sound effects have a lot of charm to it, including the sounds associated with the monthly news messages that come in on occassion. Admittedly, though, after hours of "testing" the game the 'oooh's and 'aaah's can get on ones nerves. We've finally introduced an option to disable these sound effects entirely. The option can be found in the news options tab in the messages window.

## Vehicle route order command reimplementation (#1961, #1962, #1977, #1981)

The game commands dealing with the vehicle route order table have all been reimplemented. This means inserting, deleting, and moving up/down of vehicle orders now happens entirely in C++. Reimplementing these game commands is all working towards a unified interface with multiplayer games in mind.

## Vehicle speed control and refit command reimplementation (#1954, #1958)

Similarly, we have reimplemented the game commands dealing with vehicle speed control (manual driving) and refitting of ships and aircraft (cargo). Nice!

## Allow reversing a vehicle's route order table (#1973)

Sometimes your complicated traffic network could do with a vehicle going in the exact opposite direction from how you originally planned it to. No longer do you need to carefully mark each waypoint again: now you can reverse a vehicle's order table with one click. Simply press the yellow arrow button at the bottom of the route tab. Of course, this works for cloned vehicles as well.

## Stream class refactors (#1979, #1982)

Many parts of OpenLoco use custom stream classes for interacting with binary game data. The initial implementations, a few years old at this point, sufficed for what they were doing, but were not very optimised. @ZehMatt set off to split them into separate unit files, streamlined their interfaces, added tests, and has started work on optimising them. The initial benchmarks look very promising. To be continued!

# OpenLoco version 23.05 (2023-05-27)

## Construct With Clear (#1899)
Two months ago, @duncanspumpkin started working on this with the comment "This is going to take a little while" -- and indeed it did! The construct with clear function is a core part of many Game Commands. This function is a bit of a swiss army knife. It can tell you if the location you are trying to construct is underwater/underground/overground/clashes with ground, or if there are tile elements in the way. It can also be further customised to remove elements as it's checking for clearance. Getting this to interop with the existing game was a challange, but now that it's done, it opens up implementing many of the placement Game Commands, e.g. CreateBuilding.

## Fix C++20 Issues (#1932)
Currently the codebase is built using the C++17 standard. We would like to move to C++20 in the short-term, as there are some great new features in the newer standard. This PR addressed many of the compile issues. There is now only one area left to address, but unfortunately it's the biggest problem: moving to `char8_t` and `std::u8string`. We will need to make a number of UTF-8 related changes to really be ready for C++20, but it is getting nearer. Expect a number of UTF-8 related changes over the next month. #1937, for example, brings UTF-8 to the Windows command-line.

## Refactoring Game Command Args (#1914, #1915, #1917, #1918, #1919)
Continuing from last month, @reinaldorauch split up his big argument refactor into a number of bite size chunks. We are now starting to have a consistent interface for Game Commands. There is still a good many left to refactor, though. This is a good area for newcomers, so contributions are always welcome.

## Construction window bug (#1940)
We'd like to bring special attention to #1940 by @LeftofZen. While it started out as a refactor PR, centralising some memory handling, it accidentally fixed a very vexxing bug that made using the construction window impossible under certain situations. It was caused by a type issue in a `loco_global`, which was refactored out by this PR. This goes to show how important strict types are while interopting with vanilla code! We're glad to fixed at last, as it had been bugging us for too long.

## Misc. Refactors (#1926, #1921, #1943, #1950, #1951)
A handful of minor refactors were contributed by @memellis and other team members, enforcing our newer code styles: enum class flags, and using our new logging library.

# OpenLoco version 23.04.1 (2023-04-27)

Whilst implementing one of the vehicle game commands for v23.04 a refactor went slightly wrong causing the local/express setting of a train to constantly be reset. Woops! Eventually we hope to have a proper testing system that would capture this sort of mistake but its hard to add such a testing system whilst we depend on the base game.

## Pack all custom objects (#1925)

Many custom objects for locomotion were made by modifying an existing vanilla object. Unfortunately most object makers did not modify the base game field to indicate that it was a custom object. This meant that the object would not be packed into the save even when the export objects option is used. We now check if an object is from the base game by comparing it to the complete list of base game objects ensuring that they are all packed.

## Introduce object load error window (#1933)

It can be incredibly frustrating when loading a save only to find out you don't have all the objects installed to load it. In the base game an error message was generated that told you of only one missing object. We now display a window for all the missing objects.

# OpenLoco version 23.04 (2023-04-23)

## Refactor arg structs for game commands (#1893, #1916)

As part of our ongoing efforts to reimplement all game commands in C++, we are refactoring the game command's argument structs to be higher-level. Currently, most are still passing registers into vanilla functions. We have devised a wrapper structure to make our C++ code more readable in the mean time, while at the same time preparing for command serialization for future multiplayer.
This month, @duncanspumpkin and @reinaldorauch tackled a bunch of these refactors, even if not all of them have been merged yet.

## Implement two more vehicle game commands (#1923, #1924)

Related to the previous section, @AaronVanGeffen implemented two more vehicle game commands: the vehicle 'reverse' command, and the vehicle 'pass signal' command.

## Improved diagnostics and tests (#1894, #1904)

@ZehMatt reworked our console logging interfaces into a new Diagnostics module. This allows log messages to easily be saved to file for reference, and for easier extension and reuse in the future. In addition, more tests for our custom string functions were added. Hopefully, this will prevent regressions from popping up when we switch to Unicode for internal strings in the future.

## Switching from Docker Hub to GitHub for CI images (#1896)

To the unpleasant surprise of many open source projects, Docker Hub announced that they were ending their free tier for open source teams. This prompted us to look for an alternative, which we found close to our project's home on GitHub. @janisosaur steered this direction to a good end.

## More vehicle flag refactors (#1898)

For a healthy code base, and in anticipation of a future new save format, we have been working on using strict types as much as a we can. Owing to @ZehMatt's recent innovations for flag typing, we have been slowly replacing separate constants with *enum classes* over the past few months. This month, @reinaldorauch refactored more of the vehicle flags.

## Allow hooking non-aligned function addresses (#1907)

As a result of the implementation of last month's town growth functions, we discovered some processors had trouble with us hooking functions that would misalign address-wise on particular processors. Notably, our Windows builds were no longer working through Wine on macOS. Thanks to @janisosaur's detective work and swift fix, this is working once again.

## GameState integration (#1911, #1912)

OpenLoco's code base has been relatively good in its relatively small use of globals. Over the past months, we have been reducing them further back into a *game state*. This month, a few more globals were integrated into the game state struct once again.

## Dealing with compiler warnings (#1913, #1920)

For a healthy code base, we aim for our code to compile without warnings on the GCC, clang, and MSVC compilers. This month, a pesky warning in the paint routines was vanquished. We can compile without warnings, once again!


# OpenLoco version 23.03 (2023-03-16)

## Implement remaining object loading functions [#1851, #1848]
At the start of this month, we finished the remaining object loading functions. The last two were the hardest ones: Vehicle and Tree. Tree might be a bit of a surprise to have such a complex loader, but it's all to do with the various seasons that trees can have, as well as their shadows. Due to the complexity of these two, we made a few mistakes, but we think we have managed to iron out all the bugs prior to the release.

## Implement Town Grow Functions [#1740, #1742]
Many people have mentioned that they don't like how towns grow in the game. Before we can overhaul how they work, we need to first implement the existing behaviour. Unfortunately, the main town growth function is large spaghetti of code, so to make it as simple to implement as possible, we are going to implement all of its calling functions before tackling the main function. This helps us understand the main meat of the function.

## Project layout [#1850, #1855, #1859, #1867, #1868, #1873, #1879]
@ZehMatt has been continuing his work with laying out our codebase in a more logical manner. Along the way, FmtLib has been introduced to OpenLoco. FmtLib is the basis of the C++20 std::format, and it is a very nice library for formatting text. It should lead to much neater code for error messaging and logging. This, in turn, will mean we will likely write more error messages and logs, as it's much easier to write.

## Implement Final Window Function [#1881]
Not only did we finish off all of the object load functions this month, we also finished off the last window function, the Station Tool's update event. The tool update functions are used to show the ghost previews of the tool you have active. Stations are quite complex, as you have rail, road, airports and docks. This leads to complex code, hence why this final function had been ignored until now. Now that all the functions have been implemented, we can start removing the legacy interop callers, and rearrange parameters into more logical structures. There are still a good many functions that use windows indirectly, so we do still have some constraints, though.

## Implement Parts of Clear Land [#1872]
@AaronVanGeffen has been chipping away at the clear land game command. It's a surprisingly tricky one, so it's been split into a couple of chunks. Hopefully, next month we will have it over the line.

## Implement Drawing Engine Functions [#1836, #1861, #1862]
@niceeffort had a shot at implementing the fillRect function for the drawing engine. This function, surprisingly enough, draws solid rectangles. It has a number of additional modes for different patterns though, which makes the code a little complex. Luckily, it's all very similar to OpenRCT2. In addition, we finished off the missing draw string centred function.

## Implement Remove Tree [#1866]
Another @niceeffort function implemented. This time, it's the low level tree removal function. One interesting detail about removing a tree is that the destruction sound has its pitch adjusted by a random amount. This pitch adjustment means that removing 100s of trees at once doesn't produce a high volume sound. Neat!

## Enumeration flag conversion [#1778, #1819, #1891]
Continuing from last month, @reinaldorauch, @niceeffort, and @leslieyip02 converted the last few remaining flags to the stricter enum classes. Along the way, one or two mistakes in existing code were noticed and fixed, showing the refactor isn't just for aesthetics. Great work!

# OpenLoco version 23.02 (2023-02-19)

## Implement object loading functions [#1822, #1824, #1829, #1834, #1842, #1846]
This month, our journey towards implementing the object load functions continues. As of this release, we're nearly at the finish line! As we noted in last month's development log, these loading functions handle data such as sprites, animations, and localisable strings. Implementing these functions will eventually make it possible to introduce our own object format, increasing limits further down the line. Exciting stuff to look forward to!

## Enumeration flag conversions [37 separate PRs]
This month, @niceeffort converted most of the flags in OpenLoco to use strict enumeration class types. Building on the work introduced in the past month, these new types make it easier to spot mistakes -- both for ourselves, and the C++ compiler. Ultimately, this should lead to less bugs, which is nice for everyone :-)

## Object selection window improvements [#1833, #1837]
Players with many objects (mods) in their Locomotion folders will often have to spend much time looking for particular objects when designing custom scenarios. No longer! You can now find objects by display name or filename, simply by typing in the new filter box. With the object selection window having been made available in-game since December 2022, this should make scenario play even more fun.

## Split off more code into modules [#1771, #1785, #1800, #1844]
A longtime contributor and friend from the OpenRCT2 project, @ZehMatt, recently joined forces with us to help out moduralise the OpenLoco project further. This helps us compartmentalise and test the code base better, ultimately leading to better, more reusable code.

## Right-click panning is smooth again [#1475]
A bug that has been plaguing OpenLoco for a while is the map panning being slow when the 'uncap FPS' option were disabled. It turns out to have been introduced by that very same option, making this a regression. Thanks to @ZehMatt, the bug has been vanquished, making the game buttery smooth while panning, once again.

## Renderer code improvements [#1766, #1796, #1799, #1835, #1838]
Another of @ZehMatt's projects has been the UI rendering. While OpenLoco code already takes care to split core game logic from UI logic, we have had difficulty to split UI code from the viewport (map) buffers. @ZehMatt's recent efforts will ultimately make it possible to scale the UI separately from the rest of the game. Very exciting indeed!

# OpenLoco version 23.01 (2023-01-25)

## Implement Object Loading Functions [#1739, #1746, #1747, #1749, #1752, #1753, #1758, #1759]
The main focus of this month has been implementing the object loading functions. When the game loads an object from file it has a header which specifies many of the properties of the object but there are a number of fields within the header that are left empty. It is the object loading function that fills in those empty spaces. In general it is for dynamically sized data such as strings, images and animation maps. Locomotion has been designed cleverly so that these dynamic elements are in one memory allocation. A singular memory allocation improves the loading time and may also marginally improve the game speed. Almost all of the object loading functions have now been implemented but a few of the more tricky ones remain for next month.

## Config Enum Flags [#1760]
Special thanks to @leslieyip02 for this pull request (and his future one[s] that will be into next months release). This was start of rolling out the Enum Flags that were added last month.

## Improve the OpenLoco First-Run Experience [#1764]
In order for OpenLoco to run, the original Locomotion game asset files are needed. In many cases, the game is able to automatically detect its location. However, if that wasn't the case, a prompt would be displayed asking to locate the Locomotion folder manually. The phrasing for this prompt was quite spartan, however, which led to some confusion. We have rephrased the prompt messages, so the first-run experience should be markedly improved as of v23.01.

# OpenLoco version 22.12 (2022-12-22)

## Introduce Enum Flags [#1741]
One of the limitations of C++ is that there is no nice native way to handle flags for a type. There are many alternative ways of doing it all with positives and negatives. For the history of the project we had been using a namespace of constexpr values. This was easy to use but it wasn't type safe. @ZehMatt suggested using Macro to add helper functions to a traditional enum class. This improves the type safety of the flags and reduces the chance of accidental bugs. Next month we will roll out this change to all of the flags of the game to ensure consistency.

## Implement Object Image Table Loading [#1733]
Almost all .DAT files contain an image table for the sprites used in game. Depending on the type of the object this table has a certain size. Implementing the loading function has helped identify a minor new feature compared to RCT2. Images it appears can have a flag to indicate that they are a duplicate of the previous image. We aren't entirely sure why this feature is required but its interesting.

## Implement S5 functions [#1726]
These functions are used to quickly read the main headers of save files and scenario files. The details are then used for display in the Save Selection and Scenario Selection windows. This represented some of the last of the S5 loading functionality and paves the way for introducing our own save format!

## Support Building Flatpak Images (Linux) [#1711]
Special thanks to @garethppls for this pull request. These changes to the CMake allow for OpenLoco to be built as a flatpak image for ease of use on the Linux platform. The next stage of this will be to add a CI job to create flatpak images automatically.

## Split off Utility and Core Libraries [#1713]
After last months CMake refactoring it was finally time to start splitting up the repository into a number of libraries and adding unit tests. After extracting Utility and adding tests it identified a number of edge cases we hadn't accounted for in the libraries so it hopefully will reduce bugs. There is still plenty to move into these two libraries and plenty of tests to add but its a start.

# OpenLoco version 22.11 (2022-11-20)

## Implement Industry Functions [#1643, #1669, #1694, #1700, #1707, #1716]
A number of pull requests all focused on industry related functions. These represent almost all of the remaining industry functions. All that remains for industry is to implement CreateIndustry GameCommand and IndustryObject load. At this point almost all of the industry related structures have been mapped and are mostly understood. There is not much that is not known about industries.

## Misc Refactors [#1706, #1705, #1701, #1715]
No code base is without violations to coding style or minor design issues. These refactors help ensure the codebase is consistent, sensible and compiles quickly. All of which improve the speed at which new features can be implemented and code can be understood. Special thanks to @tnixeu who is not part of the regular team for his refactor.

## Rename free/get ScenarioText and implement them [#1697, #1720]
The name of these functions come from our original work on OpenRCT2. The name was badly given in OpenRCT2 but it stuck with the codebase for a long time. We used the same name in OpenLoco but it is now finally renamed to load/free TemporaryObject. Which is much clearer as to its purpose.

## Project Layout Change CMake [#1686]
The whole project has been reorganised and the majority of the CMake scripts have been rewritten to allow for modularising parts. This will allow us to write unit tests for sections of code. In addition on Windows VCPKG will automatically download and then download all of the dependencies. This allows for a much simplified developer experience. Unfortunately this has meant that we have had to retire the old MSVS .sln and .vcxproj files. All building of the project now happens through CMake.

## PaletteMap Cleanup [#1675]
Internally the game draws everything with a 256 colour palette. To handle transparencies and shadows the game has a number of maps that are used to apply these transparency effects. This PR cleaned up how the palettes were used and identified a major source of use after free which could potentially cause issues. Luckily there were no issues but its all much clearer now.

## Add Loco String Functions [#1642]
Internally locomotion uses its own form of strings. These strings can have inline parameters and arguments or arguments passed as a separate variable. To achieve this the game assumes that all text is a C-string, mostly ASCII (7bit) and uses some of the spare bits for argument indication (sentinels). This causes some havoc with trying to support non-Latin languages as we ideally need to move to UTF-8. The arguments vary from 1-4 bytes of information and crucially they might have 0 as one of those bytes. This potential 0 means that all C-string functions strcat, strcpy, strlen may work incorrectly and not understand the string. Therefore we now have locoStrlen, locoStrcpy to replace them. Eventually we will require to rework all string handling so that arguments are safely encoded in (hopefully) UTF-8 but that is a long way off.

# OpenLoco version 22.10 (2022-10-09)

## Change Company Face Game Command [#1656]
Changing the company face is much more complex than you might think. Each company face is a separate Object and changing the face requires unloading and loading objects. This is something that CS generally avoids and limits to the scenario editor. It gives key insight as to how to enable the object selection window in sandbox play and how best to network the object selection window in the future.

## Change Company Name Game Commands [#1640]
These game commands are pretty self explanatory. The implementation allowed for fixing some known buffer overflows in the original code. These were the last change name game commands to implement.

## Industry Manager Functions [#1605, #1621]
Implement various Industry Manager functions. These functions were used at the end of each month to build new industries if the game decided that there was not enough. It has helped to expose a large amount of the flags that an Industry Object can have and the information will be of use to any modders or min/maxers. IndustryManager::findRandomNewIndustryLocation is the key function for this.

## Refactors
A number of code style refactors and cleanups to help unify the codebase. There are luckily not many code style issues in the codebase anymore.

## Build
CMake is a build system that is the defacto standard in C++. We are slowly moving OpenLoco to being a purely CMake project and removing the MS .sln file. This will help unify the build experience across Windows and Linux. As an added bonus it will mean Linux devs do not need to understand the MS .vcxproj file format to be able to add new files or move files around. There is still further work to do though before removal of the .sln file.

## Misc
Added a development log (this). Most items in the project will be covered in the changelog but for items that do not normally warrant a changelog entry they will be captured under this log.
