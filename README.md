# 1 Introduction

**OpenLoco** is an open-source re-implementation of Chris Sawyer's Locomotion (CSL). CSL is the spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon and OpenLoco aims to improve the game similar to how [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org) improved Transport Tycoon and [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.io) improved RollerCoaster Tycoon.

Chris Sawyer's Locomotion was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly, building on top of his RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 engine. Much of the code is 1:1 with RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. However, the engine has changed substantially enough that OpenLoco currently does not share its codebase with OpenRCT2.

Recent implementation efforts have focussed on re-implementing the UI, so that the data structures involved may be better understood. Once this is done, it is our hope the game logic will be easier to understand and implement.

# 3 Building the game

## 3.1 Building prerequisites

OpenLoco requires original files of Chris Sawyer's Locomotion to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356430/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/chris_sawyers_locomotion).

Regardless of platform, the following libraries/dependencies are required:
- [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
- [libzip](https://libzip.org)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
- [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)

### Windows
- 7 / 8 / 10
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
  - Desktop development with C++
  - Dependencies are managed with [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)

### Linux / macOS
- cmake
- make or ninja
- 32-bit versions of the libraries mentioned above

---

## 3.2 Compiling and running
### Windows:
1. Check out the repository. This can be done using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [other tools](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use).
2. Open a new Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019, then navigate to the repository (e.g. `cd C:\GitHub\OpenLoco`).
3. Run `msbuild openloco.sln /t:restore;build`
4. Run `mklink /D bin\data ..\data` or `xcopy data bin\data /EIY`
5. Run the game, `bin\openloco`

### Linux / macOS:
The standard CMake build procedure is to install the required libraries, then:
```
mkdir build
cd build
CXXFLAGS="-m32" cmake ..
make
```

Running the game will need the data directory from the root of the source code next to the binary. Assuming you're in `$SRC/build`, 
```
ln -s ../data
OR
cp -r ../data ./data 
```
